# BL2CK-1.30.4-YS
Mirror of BL2CK 1.30.4 kernel, with updated infolib.dat and extinfo.dat. This should help previously problematic games like AC:Wild World and others to boot properly on BL2CK.

Also has a slightly edited version of the stock BL2CK theme - Displays `BL2CK Kernel - 1.30.4` on the top screen instead of `R4iNP Kernel - Give You New Feeling`

None of the files provided here are made by me. I am simply repacking them for convenience, since the BL2CK on the DS Flashcard Archive ships with older .dats.
All credit goes to the developers of BL2CK and contributors, as well as RGF for the loader dats. (infolib.dat and extinfo.dat)
